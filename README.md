# Next.js Starter Template

This repository is a Next.js starter template designed to help you quickly set up a project with the following tools and technologies:

- **Next.js**: The React Framework for production
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript code
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter
- **Husky**: Git hooks made easy
- **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript
- **shadcn/ui**: UI components for your project
- **React Query**: Hooks for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-starter-template.git
   cd nextjs-starter-template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project or you can copy the `.sample.env` file and add your environment variables. For example:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
   ```

4. **Set up repository secrets:**

- `GH_PAT` (GitHub Personal Access Token)
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` (Vercel Organization ID)
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (Vercel Project ID)
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` (Vercel Token)

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To start the database server, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Prisma

To generate Prisma client, run:

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma generate
```

To run Prisma migrations, run:

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma migrate dev
```

### Build

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Lint

To run ESLint and check for linting errors, run:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

### Format

To format your code with Prettier, run:

```bash
pnpm run format
```

### Husky

Husky is used to manage Git hooks. This project is set up with a pre-commit hook to run ESLint and Prettier. The hooks are configured in the `.husky` directory.

### Additional Information

#### ESLint

This project uses a custom ESLint configuration to ensure code quality and consistency. You can modify the ESLint rules in the `.eslintrc.json` file.

#### Prettier

Prettier is configured to automatically format your code. You can customize the Prettier configuration in the `.prettierrc` file.

#### Husky

Husky is configured to run ESLint and Prettier checks before each commit. You can modify the hooks in the `.husky` directory.

#### Prisma

Prisma is used to interact with the database. The Prisma schema is defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file. You can configure your database connection in the `.env` file.

#### shadcn/ui

shadcn/ui provides a set of reusable UI components. You can find these components in the `ui` directory and use them throughout your application.
